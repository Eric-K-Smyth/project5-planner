# Work Day Scheduler



## Description

This project was made to create a way of effectivly managing my time.
It solves the problem of forgetting what you're supposed to be doing, and providing a timeframe to do it.
Through this project I have learned how to utilize 3rd party API's such as Bootstrap, Jquery and Date.js

## Installation

No instalation required. Runs in browswer, saves to local storage

## Usage

On the page there will be boxes labed 9am - 5pm
The boxes change colour acording to the time of day
If the label on the box is in the past, it will be grey, the present will be red, and the future, green.
Type notes into a box and press the save icon on the righthand side, the note will save to local storage.
